# British Airways Lounge Eligibility – Data Science Case Study

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a **data science case study** completed as part of the  
**British Airways Data Science Job Simulation** offered by **Forage**.

The project focuses on **modeling lounge eligibility at Heathrow Terminal 3** using a
clear, business-oriented, and explainable approach.

> ⚠️ Disclaimer  
> This project is part of a **virtual job simulation**.  
> It is **not an official British Airways internal system** and does not use real customer data.

## 🎯 Task Objective
To design a **simple and scalable model** that estimates **lounge eligibility percentages**
by categorizing flights into:
- Short-haul routes
- Long-haul routes

The model is intended to:
- Reflect airline business logic
- Be reusable for future schedules
- Avoid over-dependence on specific aircraft or routes

---

## 🧠 Approach
- Flights are grouped into **short-haul** and **long-haul**
- Lounge eligibility is estimated using **assumption-based modeling**
- Long-haul routes are assumed to have:
  - Higher premium passenger share
  - More loyalty members
- Short-haul routes are assumed to have:
  - Lower premium concentration

This approach prioritizes **clarity, justification, and operational usability**.
